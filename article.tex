\begin{abstract}

In the proliferation of the recent HTML5 technologies, web platforms, especially 
mobile web platforms, have been achieving remarkable advancements in terms of 
gaining supported features via markup, CSS, and relatively simple JavaScript 
APIs.  To reflect this tech movement, many browser vendors, including Mozilla, 
Chrome, Opera, and Safari, have already started to implement them in their 
browsers, in which uncannily introducing HTML5 to be a gist of those web 
platforms. At the same time, HTML5 features are actively discussed for 
standardization to better take into account the recent development activities at 
a number of W3C's working groups\cite{whatwg.w3c}$^{,}$~\cite{dapwg.w3c}$^{,}$
\cite{webrtcwg.w3c}.
% a number of W3C's working groups\cite{whatwg.w3c}\cite{dapwg.w3c}
% \cite{webrtcwg.w3c}.

Tizen platform also implements many of the attractive HTML5 features such as
WebRTC\cite{webrtc.w3c}, WebAudio API\cite{webaudioapi.w3c}, File 
API\cite{fileapi.w3c}, and various Device APIs (vibration 
API\cite{vibrationapi.w3c}, battery status API\cite{batteryapi.w3c}, Network 
Information API\cite{netinfoapi.w3c}, etc) of which are almost completed as of 
now.  Amongst these implemented features in Tizen, we would particularly like to 
take a chance to demonstrate our WebRTC implementation using a sample 
peer-to-peer application in this conference; the sample app calls a series of 
JavaScript APIs associated with {\sf getUserMedia}\cite{getusermedia.w3c} and 
{\sf PeerConnection API} defined in the WebRTC spec\cite{webrtc.w3c}.

Lastly, we would like to talk, at the conference, about Tizen's future direction 
in extending the remaining and upcoming HTML5 features that can drive it to be a 
more solid yet flexible web-based platform. \\
